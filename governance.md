# SimPEG Project Governance

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process used in both ordinary and extraordinary situations. It is also meant to clarify how decisions are made. 

## The Project

The SimPEG Project (The Project) is a community-driven project that develops and maintains open-source software for simulations and inversions of geophysical data. Software repositories include those in the [SimPEG github organization](https://github.com/simpeg). They are developed openly and hosted on public repositories. Software developed by The Project is released under the MIT (or similar) open source license. 

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code, documentation, designs, examples, or other work to the Project, including answering questions and participating on discussion forums. Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting, reviewing, and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on GitHub, discussion forums, and other channels. 

The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project. Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible.

The Project is not a legal entity, nor does it currently have any formal relationships with legal entities.

## Governance 

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The Project roles are:
- Founders
- Managing Director
- Director of Operations
- Contributors
- Community

### Founders 
The project founders are the people who started SimPEG. They hold no special authority in The Project, other than if a successor to the Managing Director is not able to be appointed. They are consulted on decisions concerning project leadership, governance, and vision. The project founders are:
- Rowan Cockett ([@rowanc1](https://github.com/rowanc1))
- Lindsey Heagy ([@lheagy](https://github.com/lheagy))
- Seogi Kang ([@sgkang](https://github.com/sgkang))

### Current Directors 
The current project directors are:
- Managing Director: Lindsey Heagy ([@lheagy](https://github.com/lheagy))
- Director of Operations: Joe Capriotti ([@jcapriot](https://github.com/jcapriot))

### Managing Director

This person is responsible for planning, organization, and direction of the organization's operations and programs. There is an expectation that this person invests efforts in community & organizational strategy as well as in working with the community to develop and act on the long-term vision of the project.

This person also fulfills the role of a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) as is common in other open-source projects. As Dictator, they, have the authority to make all final decisions for The Project. As Benevolent, they, in practice, chooses to defer that authority to the consensus of the community discussion channels (see below). It is expected, and in the past has been the case, that the Managing Director will only rarely assert his/her final authority. Because rarely used, we refer to the Managing Director’s final authority as a “special” or “overriding” vote. When it does occur, the Managing Director override typically happens in situations where there is a deadlock in building concensus among the Community. The Project encourages others to fork the project if they disagree with the overall direction the Managing Director is taking. The Managing Director may delegate his/her authority on a particular decision or set of decisions to any other Contributor at his/her discretion.

The Managing Director can appoint his/her successor, but it is expected that the Community (through the community discussion channels) would be consulted on this decision. If the Managing Director is unable to appoint a successor, the Founding Team will make this decision - preferably by consensus, but if needed, by a majority vote.

Note that the Managing Director can step down at any time, and acting in good faith, will also listen to serious calls to do so. 

### Director of Operations 

This person oversees and manages an organization's day-to-day operations to ensure the organization achieves its objectives. This person coordinates maintenance & development, for example facilitating pull request reviews and software releases (Note that this doesn’t mean that they have to do all of the PR reviews and releases!). There is an expectation that this person invests in the technical and architectural strategy of the project. 

### Community Discussion Channels 

### Institutional Partners


### Updates to Governance

We will hold an annual meeting dedicated to discussions of project governance in TODO:Month. At these meetings, we will review governance documents including this document and project roadmaps. Anyone is welcome to join these meetings. The authority to change the governance model is held by the Managing Director, but any changes to the governance model will be done in a consensus building process with the Managing Director, Project Contributors and the Community. 

Suggestions to governance processes can always be raised in the interm at weekly meetings, in the #governance channel on [slack](http://slack.simpeg.xyz), or directly to the project directors.
