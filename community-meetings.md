# Community meetings 

This document is meant to track strategic meetings that we hold in the SimPEG community. These meetings are distinct from the weekly meetings in that they are dedicated meetings for reflecting on where we have been and planning where we are headed as a community and as a project. These meetings will be announced on mattermost and links to meeting notes will be captured in this document.
